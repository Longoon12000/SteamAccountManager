# Steam Account Manager
Handle logins of multiple Steam accounts on the same machine with ease!

## What does this do?

If you have multiple Steam accounts you probably know the hassle of having to re-type the username, password and even get the two factor authentification every time you want to switch accounts.

This application allows you to quickly switch between your Steam accounts with two clicks and without having to re-authenticate.

## Setup

1. Start the Steam Account Manager
2. Open the Steam Account Manager Window (double click the icon in the notification area)
3. Add all your accounts to the Steam Account Manager
4. For each account in the Steam Account Manager:
4. 1. Select the account name
4. 2. Click on Login
4. 3. Do the login (password, authenticator) and check [X] Remember my password in Steam
4. 4. Repeat 4.i. - 4.iv. for all your accounts

## Usage

After setting up your accounts you can right-click the icon in the notification area to select an account or double-click the icon to open the main window to manage accounts.

Be aware that selecting an account will instantly quit Steam, which will in turn quit any open Game without prompt or saving, so make sure that you saved everything before switching!
